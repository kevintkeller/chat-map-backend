/**
 * JWT TOKEN: JSON WEB TOKEN is an opern standard that defines a compact and
 * self-contained way for securely transmitting between parties as a JSON object.
 * This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs
 * can be signed using a secret (with the HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key
 * pair using RSA or ECDSA.
 * 
 * CONTENTS OF A JWT TOKEN:
 *      -Header: typically consists of two parts: the type of the token, which is JWT, and the signing algorithm being used, such as HMAC SHA256 or RSA
 *      -Payload (things we want to send): contains claims. Claims are statements about an entity (typically, the user) and additional data. There are three types of claims: registered, public, and private claims.
 *      -Signature: To create the signature part you have to take the encoded header, the encoded payload, a secret, the algorithm specified in the header, and sign that.
